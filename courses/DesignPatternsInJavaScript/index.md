# Design Patterns in JavaScript

## List of content

- [SOLID Design Principles](./notebook/en/SOLID.md)

- Design Principles:
  - [Builder](./notebook/en/builder.md)
    - Separate component for when object construction gets too complicated.
    - Can create mutually cooperating sub-builders.
    - Often has a fluent interface.
  - [Factory](./notebook/en/factory.md)
    - Factory method more expressive than constructor.
    - A separate class with factory methods is a Factory.
    - Class hierarchies can have corresponding hierarchies of factories (Abstract Factory).
  - [Prototype](./notebook/en/prototype.md)
    - Creation of object from an existing object.
    - Requires either explicit deep copy or copy through serialization.
    - Additional work required to preserve type.
  - [Singleton](./notebook/en/singleton.md)
    - When you need to ensure just a single instance exists.
    - Can return same object from constructor on every call.
    - Direct dependence on a Singleton is dangerous.
  - [Adapter](./notebook/en/adapter.md)
    - Converts the interface you get to the interface you need.
  - [Bridge](./notebook/en/bridge.md)
    - Decouple abstraction from implementation.
  - [Composite](./notebook/en/composite.md)
    - Allows clients to treat individual objects and composition of objects uniformly.
  - [Decorator](./notebook/en/decorator.md)
    - Attach additional responsabilities to objects without modifiying those object or inheriting from them.
    - Decorators are composable with each other.
  - [Fa√ßade](./notebook/en/facade.md)
    - Provide a single unified interface over a set of system/interfaces.
  - [Flyweight](./notebook/en/flyweight.md)
    - Memory saving technique
    - Efficiently support very large numbers of similar objects.
  - [Proxy](./notebook/en/proxy.md)
    - Provide a surrogate object that forwards calls to the real object whilte performing additional fucntions.
    - Access control, communication, logging, etc.
  - [Chain of Responsability](./notebook/en/chain-of-responsibility.md)
    - Allow components to process information/events in a chain.
    - Each element in the chain refers to next element.
    - Make a list and go through it.
  - [Command](./notebook/en/command.md)
    - Encapsulate a request into a separate object.
    - Good for audit, replay, undo/redo.
    - Part of CQS/CQRS
  - [Interpreter](./notebook/en/interpreter.md)
    - Transform textual input into object-oriented structures.
    - Used by interpreters, compilers, static analysis tools, etc.
    - Compiler theory is a separate branch of Computer Science.
  - [Iterator](./notebook/en/iterator.md)
    - Provides an interface for accessing elements of an aggregate object.
    - Object can be made iterable (for loop).
  - [Mediator](./notebook/en/mediator.md)
    - Provides mediation servies between two objects.
  - [Memento](./notebook/en/memento.md)
    - Yields tokens representing system states.
    - Tokens do not allow direct manipulation, but can be used in appropriate APIs.
  - [Observer](./notebook/en/observer.md)
    - Allows notifications of changes/happening in a component.
  - [State](./notebook/en/state.md)
    - We model system by having one of a possible states and transitions between these states.
    - Such a system is called a `state machine`.
    - Special frameworks exists to orchestrate state machines.
  - [Strategy](./notebook/en/strategy.md) and [Template method](./notebook/en/template-method.md)
    - Both define a skeleton algorithm with details filled in by implementor.
    - Strategy uses ordinary composition, template method uses inheritance.
  - [Visitor](./notebook/en/visitor.md)
    - Allows non-intrusive addition of functionality tho hierarchies.
