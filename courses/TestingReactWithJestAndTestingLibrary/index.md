# Testing React with Jest & Testing Library

## Used libraries:

- `Jest`: Runs, searches and determines if a test is successful.
- `React Testing Library`: It is not only a library, it is a philosophy of opinionated work, i.e. it contains default methods to run tests, it does not need specific implementation, it finds elements by accessibility and not by id.
- `Create React App`: Pre-defined working template containing ReactJS and additional linter, error checking and active styling settings.
