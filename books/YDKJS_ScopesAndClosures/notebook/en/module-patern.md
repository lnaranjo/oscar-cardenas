# The Module Pattern

The module is one of the most important code organization patterns in all of programming. Are inherently built from what we've already covered: the payoff for your efforts in learning lexical scope and closure.

## Encapsulation and Least Exposure (POLE)

Encapsulation is often cited as a principle of object-oriented (OO) programming, but it's more fundamental and broadly applicable than that. The goal of encapsulation is the bundling or co-location of information (data) and behavior (functions) that together serve a common purpose.

Independent of any syntax or code mechanisms, the spirit of encapsulation can be realized in something as simple as using separate files to hold bits of the overall program with common purpose.

## What Is a Module?

A module is a collection of related data and functions (often referred to as methods in this context), characterized by a division between hidden private details and public accessible details, usually called the `public API.`

A module is also stateful: it maintains some information over time, along with functionality to access and update that information.

### Namespaces (Stateless Grouping)

If you group a set of related functions together, without data, then you don't really have the expected encapsulation a module implies. The better term for this grouping of stateless functions is a namespace:

```javascript
// namespace, not module
var Utils = {
  cancelEvt(evt) {
    evt.preventDefault();
    evt.stopPropagation();
    evt.stopImmediatePropagation();
  },
  wait(ms) {
    return new Promise(function c(res) {
      setTimeout(res, ms);
    });
  },
  isValidEmail(email) {
    return /[^@]+@[^@.]+\.[^@.]+/.test(email);
  },
};
```

`Utils` here is a useful collection of utilities, yet they're all state-independent functions. Gathering functionality together is generally good practice, but that doesn't make this a module. Rather, we've defined a `Utils` namespace and organized the functions under it.

### Data Structures (Stateful Grouping)

Even if you bundle data and stateful functions together, if you're not limiting the visibility of any of it, then you're stopping short of the POLE aspect of encapsulation; it's not particularly helpful to label that a module.

```javascript
// data structure, not module
var Student = {
  records: [
    { id: 14, name: 'Kyle', grade: 86 },
    { id: 73, name: 'Suzy', grade: 87 },
    { id: 112, name: 'Frank', grade: 75 },
    { id: 6, name: 'Sarah', grade: 91 },
  ],
  getName(studentID) {
    var student = this.records.find((student) => student.id == studentID);
    return student.name;
  },
};
Student.getName(73); // Suzy
```

### Modules (Stateful Access Control)

To embody the full spirit of the module pattern, we not only need grouping and state, but also access control through visibility (private vs. public).

```javascript
var Student = (function defineStudent() {
  var records = [
    { id: 14, name: 'Kyle', grade: 86 },
    { id: 73, name: 'Suzy', grade: 87 },
    { id: 112, name: 'Frank', grade: 75 },
    { id: 6, name: 'Sarah', grade: 91 },
  ];
  var publicAPI = {
    getName,
  };
  return publicAPI;
  // ************************
  function getName(studentID) {
    var student = records.find((student) => student.id == studentID);
    return student.name;
  }
})();
Student.getName(73); // Suzy
```

## Node CommonJS Modules

CommonJS modules behave as singleton instances, similar to the IIFE module definition style presented before. No matter how many times you `require(..)` the same module, you just get additional references to the single shared module instance; `require(..)` is an all-or-nothing mechanism; it includes a reference of the entire exposed public API of the module. To effectively access only part of the API.

Similar to the classic module format, the publicly exported methods of a CommonJS module's API hold closures over the internal module details. That's how the module singleton state is maintained across the lifetime of your program.

## Modern ES Modules (ESM)

The ESM format shares several similarities with the CommonJS format. ESM is file-based, and module instances are singletons, with everything private by default. One notable difference is that ESM files are assumed to be strict-mode, without needing a "use strict" pragma at the top. Thereâ€™s no way to define an ESM as non-strict-mode.

## Exit Scope

The module pattern is the conclusion of our journey in this book of learning how we can use the rules of lexical scope to place variables and functions in proper locations. POLE is the defensive private by default posture we always take, making sure we avoid over-exposure and interact only with the minimal public API surface area necessary.
