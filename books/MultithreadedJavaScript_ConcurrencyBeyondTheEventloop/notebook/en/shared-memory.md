# Shared Memory

These are two powerful tools for working with concurrency in JavaScript, allowing developers to run code in parallel in a way that wasn’t previously available to JavaScript.

## Intro to Shared Memory

An important note is the tools covered here can be dangerous, introducing logic-defying bugs to your application that slither in the shadows during development only to rear their heads in production. But when honed and used properly, these tools allow your application to soar to new heights, squeezing never-before-seen levels of performance from your hardware.

When a value is written to Float64Array, it can be left mostly as the same. The minimum allowed value is the same as Number.MIN_VALUE, while the maximum is Number.MAX_VALUE. When a value is written to a Float32Array, not only are the minimum and maximum value ranges reduced but the decimal precision will be truncated as well.

As an example of this, consider the following code:

```javascript
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);

const view64 = new Float64Array(buffer);
view64[0] = 1.1234567890123456789; // bytes 0 - 7
console.log(view64[0]); // 1.1234567890123457

const view32 = new Float32Array(buffer);
view32[2] = 1.1234567890123456789; // bytes 8 - 11
console.log(view32[2]); // 1.1234568357467651
```

## Atomic Methods for Data Manipulation

Atomicity is a term that you might have heard before, particularly when it comes to databases, where it’s the first word in the acronym ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability). Essentially, if an operation is atomic, it means that while the overall operation may be composed of multiple smaller steps, the overall operation is guaranteed to either entirely succeed or entirely fail. For example, a single query sent to a database is going to be atomic, but three separate queries aren’t atomic.

- `Atomics.add()`: This method adds the provided value to the existing value in a typedArray that is located at index.
- `Atomics.and()`: This method performs a bitwise and using value with the existing value in typedArray located at index.
- `Atomics.compareExchange()`: This method checks typedArray to see if the value oldExpectedValue is located at index. If it is, then the value is replaced with value. If not, then nothing happens. The old value is always returned, so you can tell if the exchange succeeded if oldExpectedValue === old.
- `Atomics.exchange()`: This method sets the value in typedArray located at index to value.
- `Atomics.isLockFree()`: This method returns a true if size is a value that appears as the BYTES_PER_ELEMENT for any of the TypedArray subclasses and a false if otherwise.
- `Atomics.load()`: This method returns the value in typedArray located at index.
- `Atomics.or()`: This method performs a bitwise or using value with the existing value in typedArray located at index.
- `Atomics.store()`: This method stores the provided value in typedArray located at index.
- `Atomics.sub()`: This method subtracts the provided value from the existing value in typedArray that is located at index.
- `Atomics.xor()`: This method performs a bitwise xor using value with the existing value in typedArray located at index.

## Data Serialization

Buffers are extremely powerful tools. That said, working with them from an entirely numeric point of view can start to get a little difficult. Sometimes you’ll need to store things that represent nonnumeric data using a buffer. When this happens you’ll need to serialize that data in some manner before writing it to the buffer, and you’ll later need to deserialize it when reading from the buffer.

### Booleans

Booleans are easy to represent because they take a single bit to store the data, and a bit is less than a byte.

The following is an example of how to store and retrieve these boolean values so that they’re backed in an ArrayBuffer:

```javascript
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(1);
const view = new Uint8Array(buffer);
function setBool(slot, value) {
  view[0] = (view[0] & ~(1 << slot)) | ((value | 0) << slot);
}
function getBool(slot) {
  return !((view[0] & (1 << slot)) === 0);
}
```

### Strings

Strings aren’t as easy to encode as they may seem at first glance. It’s easy to assume that each character in a string can be represented using a single byte, and that the .length property of a string is sufficient to choose the size of a buffer to store it in. While this may seem to work sometimes, particularly with simple strings, you’ll soon encounter errors when dealing with more complex data.

```javascript
// Warning: Antipattern!
function stringToArrayBuffer(str) {
  const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(str.length);
  const view = new Uint8Array(buffer);

  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    view[i] = str.charCodeAt(i);
  }

  return view;
}
stringToArrayBuffer('foo'); // Uint8Array(3) [ 102, 111, 111 ]
stringToArrayBuffer('€'); // Uint8Array(1) [ 172 ]
```

### Objects

Considering that objects can already be represented as strings using JSON, you do have the option of taking an object that you’d like to make use of across two threads, serializing it into a JSON string, and writing that string to an array buffer.

```javascript
const enc = new TextEncoder();
return enc.encode(JSON.stringify(obj));
```
