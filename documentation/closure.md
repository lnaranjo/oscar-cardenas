# Closure

## Considerations:

- Is one of the most pervasive programming functionalities
- It is a function to remember and continue to access variables from outside of this scope even when the function is executed in a different scope
- It is a natural part of a function
- To observe a closure must be execute a function in a different scope that function was originally was defined.

## Examples:

```javascript
function greeting(msg) {
  return function who(name) {
    console.log(`${msg}, ${name}`);
  };
}

const hello = greeting("Hello");
const howdy = hello("Oscar");
howdy; // Hello, Oscar

hello("Luis");
// Hello, Luis

// define a counter with a closure
function counter(step = 1) {
  let count = 0;
  return function increaseCount() {
    count += step;
    return count;
  };
}

const incBy2 = counter(2);
incBy2(); // 2
incBy2(); // 4
incBy2(); // 6
incBy2(); // 8
incBy2(); // 10

//define a customer fetcher with a closure
function getSomeData(url) {
  fetcher(url, function onResponse(data) {
    console.log({ data });
  });
}

getSomeData("https://unosquare.com"); // { data: [SOME_DATA_HERE] }
```
